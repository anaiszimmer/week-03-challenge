```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


CHALLENGE:
In one line of code, do the following:

* Add a variable, Binomial to our data frame d, which is a concatenation of the Genus and Species…
* Trim the data frame to only include the variables Binomial, Family, Brain_size_species_mean, Body_mass_male_mean...
* Group these variables by Family…
* Calculate the average value for Brain_size_species_mean, Body_mass_male_mean per Family
* And arrange by increasing average brain size

```
library(tidyverse)

#loading data
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2022-datasets/main/KamilarAndCooperData.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_names = TRUE) # creates a "tibble"
head(d)
view(d)
```
* Challenge response
```
s <- mutate(d, "Binomial" = paste(Genus, Species, sep = " "))%>%
  select(Binomial, Family, Brain_Size_Species_Mean, Body_mass_male_mean)%>%
  group_by(Family)%>%
  summarise(
    avgBS = mean(Brain_Size_Species_Mean, na.rm = TRUE),
    avgBM = mean(Body_mass_male_mean, na.rm = TRUE),
  ) %>%
    arrange(avgBM)
s



head(s)
